# AnitoCrosshatch: A 3D Editor Tool for Cross Hatch Rendered 3D Environments

AnitoCrosshatch is a 3D editor tool designed to create and edit 3D environments rendered in a cross-hatch style. It provides a user-friendly interface for artists and developers to manipulate 3D models, textures, and lighting to achieve the desired aesthetic.

Our application can perform real-time rendering with the stylized shaders, and can produce a variety of different crosshatching styles with the available parameters of our crosshatching system.

### Human Perceptual Evaluation

To complement our quantitative image similarity metrics, we conducted a human perceptual evaluation to assess how well **AnitoCrosshatch**’s cross-hatching output resembles actual comic book panels. This evaluation aimed to capture subjective quality judgments that automated metrics might miss, particularly regarding the artistic authenticity of the cross-hatching technique.

*Top: Reference comic book panel images. Bottom: Rendered images from AnitoCrosshatch.*

Each participant evaluated all 5 test images, providing ratings based on their perception of how closely the rendered cross-hatching matched the style and quality found in professional comic book panels.

The survey results reinforce our quantitative findings that AnitoCrosshatch produces cross-hatching of **moderate quality** compared to professional comic art. This suggests that while the system successfully generates the basic visual elements of cross-hatching, further refinements to the rendering algorithm may be needed to achieve higher artistic fidelity.

Future improvements could focus on enhancing the **naturalness and variability** of the cross-hatching patterns to better match the organic quality found in hand-drawn comic illustrations.
